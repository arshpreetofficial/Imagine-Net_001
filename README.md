# IMAGINE-Net

This repository contains the implementation for the paper:
**"IMAGINE-Net: A Unified Deep Learning Framework for Predicting MCI to AD Conversion Using Incomplete Neuroimaging Data"**

## Directory Structure

- `code/` - Python source code for model training, evaluation, and synthesis.
- `figures/` - Diagrams and visualizations used in the paper.
- `data/` - Placeholder for dataset links or processing scripts.
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for demos and experiments.
- `results/` - Evaluation metrics, generated images, and logs.

## Instructions

1. Download the required datasets (ADNI, OASIS, AIBL) and place symbolic links or downloaded files in `data/`.
2. Modify `config.yaml` as needed.
3. Run training: `python code/train.py`
4. Run evaluation: `python code/evaluate.py`
